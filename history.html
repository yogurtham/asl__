                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American Sign Language (ASL) has a 
                fascinating and complex history, dating back to the early 19th century, when 
                Frenchman Laurent Clerc arrived in America. Clerc was a deaf educator who brought with 
                him French Sign Language (FSL) and introduced it to the American deaf community. 
                Over time, FSL and other sign languages merged to form ASL, a sign language 
                with its own unique grammar and syntax.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                While many people believe ASL is a derivative of English, it is actually a 
                distinct and separate language with its own unique grammar and syntax. 
                ASL has been used in the United States for hundreds of years, 
                undergoing many changes and adaptations over time. It is widely used by the 
                deaf, hard-of-hearing community, interpreters, educators, and others who work 
                with the DHOH.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, ASL is recognized as an official language in the 
                United States and is used by approximately two million people across the country. 
                Many people are trying to expand its usage even further by increasing its 
                popularity in schools, colleges, and workplaces.
