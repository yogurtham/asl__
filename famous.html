                        Hellen Keller
                    </h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Helen Keller was born on June 27, 1880 in Tuscumbia, Alabama, 
                    U.S. She was an American educator, advocate for the blind and deaf, 
                    and co-founder of the ACLU. Her education and training represent an 
                    extraordinary accomplishment for people who face these disabilities. 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Keller acquired an illness that left her blind and deaf at just 
                    19 months old. At 6 years old, she was given education where she 
                    learned how to feel objects and associate them with words spelled 
                    out by finger signals on her palm, read sentences by feeling raised 
                    words on cardboard, and to make her own sentences by arranging words 
                    in a frame. At age 8, she began to learn how to speak under the guidance
                    of Sarah Fuller from the Horace Mann School for Deaf in Boston. 
                    She learned how to lip-read by placing her fingers on the lips and 
                    throat of the speaker while the words were simultaneously spelled 
                    out for her. As an adult, she spread her knowledge to others facing 
                    similar difficulties by becoming a lecturer on behalf of the American 
                    Foundation for the Blind. She later established a $2 million endowment 
                    fund, an investment portfolio with the initial capital deriving from 
                    donations, and went on tours around the world as a lecturer. A 
                    contribution to society that she is well known for is the confounding 
                    of the American Civil Liberties Union alongside American civil rights 
                    activist Roger Nash Baldwin.

                    Ludwig van Beethoven
                </h2>
                <p id="famous">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Ludwig Van Beethoven was born on December 16, 1770. 
                    He was one of the greatest and most influential composers of 
                    the Western European music tradition. Beethoven first noticed 
                    difficulties with his hearing when he was 28. However, by the 
                    time he was 44 or 45, he was totally deaf and unable to converse 
                    with others unless he passed written notes back and forth. Even 
                    though he was completely deaf, it did not stop him from composing 
                    music. Beethoven could no longer hear, so he retreated into the 
                    privacy of his imagination, heard music in his head, and wrote it 
                    down. Along with working out music in his head, he also spent a lot
                     of time improvising at the piano. The keyboard was like a lifeline 
                     for Beethoven in his deafness. Furthermore, his deafness was a slow
                      deterioration, rather than a sudden loss of hearing, so he could 
                      always imagine in his mind what his compositions would sound like. 
                      This is why Beethoven was able to write his most famous symphony, 
                      Symphony No. 9, when he was completely deaf and his most famous 
                      piano piece, Fur Elise, when he was almost completely deaf.

                    <h2>Haben Girma</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The first deaf and blind person to graduate from Harvard Law School, 
                    Haben Girma is a human rights lawyer dedicated towards disability 
                    justice. She was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, where 
                    she currently lives. Girma lost her hearing and sight from an unknown 
                    illness she had as a child.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    She says she became a lawyer to help increase access to books 
                    and other digital information for people with disabilities. 
                    She now works to change attitudes about disability around the world, 
                    including the development of accessible digital services: "Digital 
                    information is just ones and zeroes...It can be converted into any 
                    kind of format. And those people who develop these services—programmers,
                     technology designers—have an incredible power to increase access 
                     for people with disabilities. And I hope they use it.”
                     <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Throughout her lifetime, Girma has achieved several accomplishments. 
                    President Obama named her a White House Champion of Change. She received 
                    the Helen Keller Achievement Award, a spot on the Forbes 30 Under 30 
                    list, and TIME100 Talks. President Bill Clinton, Prime Minister Justin 
                    Trudeau, and Chancellor Angela Merkel have all honored Haben. Haben 
                    believes disability is an opportunity for innovation, and she teaches 
                    organizations the importance of choosing inclusion. The New York Times, 
                    Oprah Magazine, and TODAY Show featured her memoir, Haben: The Deafblind
                     Woman Who Conquered Harvard Law.
